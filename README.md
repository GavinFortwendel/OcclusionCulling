# Occlusion Culling

A dynamic occlusion culling simulator that allows the user to move around 3 different environments: A basic scene, a house scene, and a city scene. One camera in the environment represents a user view, and another camera shows an overhead view of the environment so that the occlusion culling effect can be seen

A Youtube video demonstration of the project can be found below
